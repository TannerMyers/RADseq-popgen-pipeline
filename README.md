# anole-popgen
Scripts for population and landscape genomic analysis written for Auburn University Scripting course

We will write a pipeline to perform landscape genetic analyses on a ddRADseq dataset of Anolis lizards. Our scripts will run analyses using multiple methods, including EEMS (Estimated Effective Migration Surfaces), ConStruct, Circuitscape, and environmental association analyses (potentially using BAYENV). EEMS is implemented in C++, and Circuitscape is implemented in Julia.
