# anole-popgen
Scripts for population and landscape genomic analysis written for Auburn University Scripting course

We will write a pipeline to perform a landscape genetic analyses with ddRADseq data. The data we will use for this project is a ddRADseq dataset of Anolis lizards previously obtained, but will be written such that it can be applied to any RadSeq data. Our scripts will utilize multiple methods, including EEMS (Estimated Effective Migration Surfaces), ConStruct to infer discrete population structure, Circuitscape to analyze connectivity across the landscape, and environmental association analyses to examine loci that are related to environmental variation (potentially using BAYENV or latent factor mixed models in R). EEMS is implemented in C++, Circuitscape is implemented in Julia, and BAYENV is written in C and interfaced in the command line.
